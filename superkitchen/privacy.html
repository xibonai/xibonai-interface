        </ul>
    
        <h2>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
        <p>In Short: We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal
            reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to
            provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to
            fulfill our legitimate business interests.</p>
        <p>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</p>
        <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on
            in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your
            personal information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to
                use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. <a
                    href="#">Learn more about withdrawing your consent.</a></li>
            <li><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for
                compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory
                agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which
                we are involved.</li>
            <li><strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to
                protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential
                threats to the safety of any person.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</p>
        <p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your
            personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e.,
            implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.</p>
        <p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without
            your consent, including, for example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way
            </li>
            <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
            <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
            <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an
                insurance claim</li>
            <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
            <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse
            </li>
            <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the
                accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach
                of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
            <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to
                the production of records</li>
            <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the
                collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>
            <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>
            <li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
        <p>In Short: We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following
            third parties.</p>
        <p>We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during
                negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our
                business to another company.</li>
            <li><strong>Offer Wall.</strong> Our application(s) may display a third-party hosted “offer wall.” Such an offer
                wall allows third-party advertisers to offer virtual currency, gifts, or other items to users in return for
                the acceptance and completion of an advertisement offer. Such an offer wall may appear in our application(s)
                and be displayed to you based on certain data, such as your geographic area or demographic information. When
                you click on an offer wall, you will be brought to an external website belonging to other persons and will
                leave our application(s). A unique identifier, such as your user ID, will be shared with the offer wall
                provider in order to prevent fraud and properly credit your account with the relevant reward.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>5. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</h2>
        <p>In Short: If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account, we may have access to
            certain information about you.</p>
        <p>Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details
            (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information
            about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social
            media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as
            well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.</p>
        <p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that
            are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not
            responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend
            that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information,
            and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.</p>
    
        <h2>6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
        <p>In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy
            notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>
        <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
            privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or
            other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for
            longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>
        <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
            anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
            stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any
            further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
    
        <h2>7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
        <p>In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security
            measures.</p>
        <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect

            information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to

        <h2>8. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>
        <p>In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</p>
        <p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you
            represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such
            minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of
            age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data
            from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please

            CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?” below.</p>
        <p>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>

        <p><strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal

                <h2>10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
                <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or
                    setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities
                    monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
                    has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
                    automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that
                    we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

                    have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that
                    we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you
                    submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the
                    information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email)
                    that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
                </p>
                <p>We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the
                    request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of
                    verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may
                    request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or
                    fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.

                    <li>You can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. We may deny a request
