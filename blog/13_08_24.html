        <p>The most important thing for any startup to validate is what are the problems they are actually trying to solve, areas they can increase the happiness of anyone using their offerings and the ways they can make the world a better place.</p>

        <p>Offerings can always change and adapt based on feedback and just general broader changes in external factors. I would personally love it if the users of Xibon AI found new ways for our AI offerings to add value to their lives, things that we haven’t even thought about. For now what we are focusing on are:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>How can we allow people to be more productive, enhance their capabilities and use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to extend their Human Intelligence (same for businesses).</li>
            <li>Cognitive Enhancement - Allow people and businesses the comfort of knowing they can try out different things, consume a ton of important info online, learn a new skill or innovate on a new offering all with the confidence of not having to remember everything or do it all themselves but instead having an AI driven ‘Knowledge Companion’ with them at all times.</li>
            <li>We are building AI systems that are catered for you and understand you instead of being a know-it-all system that knows everything about the internet but nothing about you. The future we believe in and what we are betting on is a personalised one, one where you and your uniqueness can finally be utilised for empowering you and your capabilities rather than the capabilities of advertisers for example.</li>
            <li>We have abundant access to free info right now but this especially for ambitious people results in information overload, FOMO about missing important info and an overall unhappiness that results from hitting limitations of being a human as a knowledge worker. Xibon AI wants to remove such limitations by enabling people and businesses access to tools they can rely on as an extension of their knowledge and their brain - depend on a personalised SuperBrain/SecondBrain that understands you and does things for you.</li>
            <li>Overcome the problem of starting - We want everyone to use our tools to help them overcome the fear of just starting, this could be to learn a new skill, a new project, a company innovating on something new or anything you have been procrastinating as a knowledge worker. Starting on anything is half the battle won and what better than having a supportive AI driven knowledge companion with you at all times taking you through the journey of your growth.</li>
            <li>Remove Bookmark hell - We all bookmark a gazillion things and never touch them - tremendous loss of important info.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why are we building this?</h2>

        <p>Call me naive but the very first idea about Xibon AI’s SuperBrain offering came out of me wanting a digital extension of myself. Something that understood what type of information mattered to me, how I am going to use different types of content, what I am trying to achieve and also made the life of someone that’s ambitious far less limiting. I wanted tools that allowed me to extend my capabilities as a knowledge worker and have access to a SuperBrain/SecondBrain that never forgot important info and a knowledge companion I could always rely on for a multitude of things.</p>

        <p>We also believe that in a future where personalised generative user interfaces (UI) will be the norm both for consumer and business applications, we can be the enablers that allow users access to super personalised interfaces that are catered specifically for them and their use cases.</p>
